Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares.



## Target Audience

Recommended for ages 3 and up. Children as young as 3 years of age can play this game, although they may not play precisely according to the rules or recognize the competitive nature of the game.


## Instructions

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Why I chose this game?

I chose this game because it is both entertaining and minimalist, and because it can be built without too much code.
